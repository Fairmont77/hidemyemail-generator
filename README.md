## Getting iCloud cookie string

> There is more than one way how you can get the required cookie string but this one is _imo_ the simplest...

1. Download [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) Chrome extension

2. Go to [EditThisCookie settings page](chrome-extension://fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg/options_pages/user_preferences.html) and set the preferred export format to `Semicolon separated name=value pairs`

3. Navigate to [iCloud settings](https://www.icloud.com/settings/) in your browser and log in

4. Click on the EditThisCookie extension and export cookies

5. Paste the exported cookies into a file named `cookie.txt` and remove the following lines:

```txt
// Semicolon separated Cookie File
// This file was generated by EditThisCookie
// Details: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt
// Example: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_cookies.htm
```

Your file should now have only one line. It should look similar to the [cookie.example.txt](./cookie.example.txt) file, just longer.
